<h1 id="kollos-mid-level-grammar-code"><a href="#TOC">Kollos &quot;mid-level&quot; grammar code</a></h1>
<p>This is the code for the &quot;middle layer&quot; of Kollos. Below it is Libmarpa, a library written in the C language which contains the actual parse engine.</p>
<p>The interface to this layer from above are a set of Lua calls, called the PLIF (Pure Lua InterFace). We expect to add a layer above this, which will parse from a DSL to the PLIF.</p>
<p>The PLIF will be a documented interface. while not as convenient as a DSL, the PLIF can be used for programming.</p>
<p>The mid-level implements the logic</p>
<ul>
<li><p>translates precedences rules to BNF.</p></li>
<li><p>translates sequence rules to BNF.</p></li>
<li><p>performs a set of normalizations on the BNF, to allow Libmarpa to be more efficient.</p></li>
<li><p>performs the Libmarpa calls that create a Libmarpa grammar.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rewriting-grammars"><a href="#TOC">Rewriting grammars</a></h2>
<p>Rewriting grammars prior to parsing is a technique long known and discuesed. A major obstacle is that parsing is almost always a means to an end -- the application is parsing as a first step to applying a semantics, and that semantics is defined in terms of the original grammar. Many of the most tempting rewrites undo the relationship between the original grammar and its semantics, to the extent that recovering it is so costly that the rewrite is counter-productive.</p>
<p>Marpa/Kollos uses only &quot;semantics-safe&quot; rewrites -- rewrite which can be undone cheaply. This approach has been tested in Marpa::R2, which translates back and forth between an pre-rewrite grammar and a post-rewrite grammar. In Marpa::R2, &quot;semantics-safe&quot; rewrites can be undone cheaply not just in post-processing, but also &quot;on the fly&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="semantics-safe-rewriting"><a href="#TOC">Semantics-safe rewriting</a></h3>
<p>We now proceed to define &quot;semantics-safe&quot;. We consider two grammars. The <em>external</em> grammar is the one before rewriting. The <em>internal</em> grammar is the one after rewriting.</p>
<p>A partial function, call it <code>brick()</code>, maps symbols in the internal grammar to the external grammar. Let <code>isym</code> be an internal symbol. <code>isym</code> is called a <em>brick</em> symbol iff <code>brick(isym)</code> is defined. <code>isym</code> is called a <em>mortar</em> symbol iff <code>isym</code> is not a brick symbol.</p>
<p>In a parse tree, a brick symbol is a terminal iff it has no brick descendents. A brick symbol is the brick root iff it has no brick ancestors. Note that a brick terminal may have mortar descendants, and a brick root may have mortar ancestors.</p>
<p>A brick symbol is a brick interior symbol iff it is not a brick root symbol and it is not a brick terminal symbol. A brick symbol is a brick non-terminal iff it is not a brick terminal symbol. A brick non-terminal may be either the brick root or a brick interior symbol.</p>
<p>In a parse tree using the external grammar, consider the subtree formed by taking a brick non-terminal as the root, and traversing the tree left-to-tree, stopping at the first brick node encountered. In the subtree formed by such a traversal, a node will be a brick iff it is a terminal of the subtree or the root node of the subtree. We say that the terminals of this subtree are the <em>brick children</em> of its root. The order of the brick children is the order in which they are encountered in the left-to-right traversal described above.</p>
<p>Let <code>i</code> be an input, whose <code>n</code>'th position we write as <code>i[n]</code>. In a parse tree, each node can also be seen as an &quot;instance&quot; of a symbol. We can write the instance as the triple <code>&lt;sym,start,length&gt;</code>, where <code>sym</code> is a symbol of the grammar, <code>start</code> is the location in <code>i</code> where the instance starts, and <code>length</code> is the instance's length. The first input location of the instnace will therefore be <code>i[start]</code> and the last location will be <code>i[start+length-1]</code>.</p>
<p>Let <code>i</code> be an input, and <code>itree</code> be a parse tree that results from parsing <code>i</code> with the internal grammar. Let <code>xtree</code> be a parse tree that results from parsing <code>i</code> with the external grammar. We say that <code>itree</code> and <code>xtree</code> are <em>brick-consistent</em>, if two conditons hold:</p>
<p>The Brick Terminal Condition: <code>&lt;xsym,start,length&gt;</code> is an instance in <code>xtree</code> iff <code>&lt;isym,start,length&gt;</code> is an brick instance in <code>itree</code>, where <code>brick(isym) == xsym</code>.</p>
<p>The Brick Non-terminal Condition: <code>&lt;xsym,start,length&gt;</code> is a non-terminal instance whose children are</p>
<pre><code>    `&lt;xsym1,start1,length1&gt;`, `&lt;xsym2,start2,length2&gt;` ...  `&lt;xsym-n,start-n,length-n&gt;`</code></pre>
<p>in <code>xtree</code> iff <code>&lt;isym,start,length&gt;</code> is a non-terminal instance in <code>itree</code> whose brick children are</p>
<pre><code>    `&lt;isym1,start1,length1&gt;`, `&lt;isym2,start2,length2&gt;` ...  `&lt;isym-n,start-n,length-n&gt;`,</code></pre>
<p>where</p>
<pre><code>    `brick(isym1) == xsym1`, `brick(isym2) == xsym2` ...  `brick(isym-n) == xsym-n`.</code></pre>
<p>We're now in a position to define a semantically-safe rewrite. A rewrite is <em>semantically-safe</em> iff, for every application of the rewrite, and for every input <code>i</code>, when both the external grammar and internal grammar is used to parse <code>i</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>every parse tree produced by the internal grammar is brick-consistent with some parse tree produced by the external grammar,</p></li>
<li><p>and vice versa, every parse tree produced by the external grammar is brick-consistent with some parse tree produced by the internal grammar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The previous definition is perhaps clearer when rephrased so that applies only to the special case in which both the internal and external grammars are unambiguous. A rewrite is <em>semantically-safe</em> iff, for every application of the rewrite, and for every input <code>i</code>, when both the external grammar and internal grammar is used to parse <code>i</code>, the parse tree produced by the internal grammar is brick-consistent with the parse tree produced by the external grammar.</p>
<h3 id="semantically-safe-rewrite-techniques"><a href="#TOC">Semantically-safe rewrite techniques</a></h3>
<p>Staying semantically-safe limits the kinds of rewrites that can be applied. But, with caution, many simple and highly useful rewrite techniques be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rules can be split into alternatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Intermediate rules with mortar symbols can be added.</p></li>
<li><p>Rules can be split up or joined.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple brick symbols can be mapped to the same external symbol.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, rules can be binarized.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the rewrites are of non-BNF rules (sequences and precedenced rules) to BNF. Others are transformations of the BNF. All of these techniques find use in the Kollos code.</p>
<h2 id="external-working-and-internal-grammars"><a href="#TOC">External, working and internal grammars</a></h2>
<p>The rewrites use 3 grammars -- external (x), working (w) and internal (i). Each has a one letter abbreviation, as shown.</p>
<p>The External grammar is either entered directly via a PLIF (Pure Lua InterFace) or indirectly, when the LUIF (LUa InterFace) is parsed into PLIF form As the name suggests, it matches the external form closely. The external form never changes, and is to kept for use by those features which must work in terms of the user's original grammar. These features include debugging, tracing, events and semantics. The external rules and symbols are what a LUIF or PLIF user sees.</p>
<p>To do the rewrite, I create a working grammar. This is highly changeable, and the rewrites take place using it.</p>
<p>Once the rewrites are done a Libmarpa grammar is created. The Libmarpa grammar's rules and symbols are tracked in the rules and symbols of Kollos's internal grammar.</p>
<p>Once the Libmarpa grammar is created, the working grammar is no longer needed and can be garbage collected. The internal grammar has links back to the external grammar. These links allow translation from internal to external, and this can be done even &quot;on the fly&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="lexemes"><a href="#TOC">Lexemes</a></h2>
<p>The transformations are not complex enough to justify the overhead of having an external, working and internal version for each lexeme. An external lexeme is created for every lexeme in the external representation.</p>
<p>Some lexemes do result from transformations. These are created directly as internal lexemes. Internal lexemes do not map to external lexemes, they are independent.</p>
<p>Lexemes are in a sense, free form. Each lexeme has a &quot;type&quot;, and zero or more values, but it up to the lexer to interpret what the type and spec means.</p>
<p>Two type are reserved: <code>cc</code> and <code>string</code>. A lexer can give them any meaning it likes, but the standard meaning is that <code>cc</code> is a character class, and that <code>string</code> is a string -- a sequence of characters.</p>
<p>Lexemes can also be open -- simply a symbol name, whose meaning is completely up to the lexer.</p>
<p>When using &quot;seamless&quot; parsing, Kollos imposes specific requirements on the lexemes in a grammar. The only lexemes allowed are those of the two reserved types: <code>cc</code> and <code>string</code>. The spec of <code>string</code> lexeme is a Lua string which is interpreted in the Lua standard way, as a sequence of characters. The spec of a <code>cc</code> lexeme is also a Lua string, but in the <code>cc</code> case the string specifies a Lua character class.</p>
<p>Internal and external lexemes are kept in a single table, referenced by <code>type</code> and <code>spec</code>. A given <code>type</code> and <code>spec</code> references at most one lexeme, which is either internal or external, not both.</p>
<h3 id="external-lexeme-constructor"><a href="#TOC">External lexeme constructor</a></h3>
<p>Create a RHS instance of type 'xlexeme' These should only be called inside of a call to the alternative_new() method. 'throw' is always set by the caller, which catches any error.</p>

<p>It is useful in Kollos to uniquely identify each RHS location of every rule. These are called <em>RHS instance</em> objects, or more often just <em>instances</em>.</p>
<p>Instances serve two purposes: First, not every RHS item is a symbol, and some object is needed to identify these non-symbol items.</p>
<p>Second, while semantics is defined in terms of rules and symbols, knowing the ID of a symbol is not always sufficient to know its semantics, which can vary by rule and even by position within rule. We can find the semantics by going back to the rule, but this will not always be convenient. Instances provide a convenient place to put information about the role a RHS item plays in the rule's semantics.</p>

<p>Working instances currently contain nothing except their <code>element</code> (the RHS item) and, for brick instances, a <code>&lt;xalt, rh_ix&gt;</code> duple that allows their semantics to be found quickly. Currently, working instances never change after creation.</p>
<p>Separators will usually (always?) be a brick element. They do not have the <code>&lt;xalt, rh_ix&gt;</code> duple defined. Instead, the <code>xalt</code> is the value of their <code>separates</code> named field.</p>

<p>Since working instances do not change after creation, they can be used to represent what are actually different instances. This is tempting when the instance contains only an <code>element</code> field, so that the instance adds essentially no information to the underlying <code>element</code>. And the elements are of course reused at different RHS instances.</p>
<p>This reuse somewhat muddies the idea of instance objects, but it is convenient, and it is used in certain places in the working grammar.</p>

<h2 id="rhs-transitive-closure"><a href="#TOC">RHS transitive closure</a></h2>
<p>The RHS transitive closure is Jeffrey's coinage, to describe a kind of property useful in Marpa.</p>
<p>Let <code>P</code> be a symbol property. We will write <code>P(sym)</code> if symbol <code>sym</code> has property P.</p>
<p>We say that the symbol property holds of a rule <code>r</code>, or <code>P(r)</code>, if <code>r</code> is of the form <code>LHS ::= RHS</code>, where <code>RHS</code> is is a series of zero or more RHS symbols, and <code>P(Rsym)</code> for every <code>Rsym</code> in <code>RHS</code>.</p>
<p>A property <code>P</code> is <em>RHS transitive</em> if and only if when <code>r = LHS ::= RHS</code> and <code>P(r)</code>, then <code>P(LHS)</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the definition of a RHS transitive property implies that every LHS of an empty rule hss that property. This is because, in the case of an empty rule, it is vacuously true that all the RHS symbols have the RHS transitive property.</p>
<p>Also note the definition only describes the transitivity of the property, not which symbols have it. That is, while <code>P</code> is a RHS transitive property, a symbol must have property <code>P</code> if it appears on the LHS of a rule with property <code>P</code>. the converse is not necessarily true: A symbol may have property <code>P</code> even if it never appears on the LHS of a rule with property <code>P</code>.</p>
<p>In Marpa, &quot;being productive&quot; and &quot;being nullable&quot; are RHS transitive properties</p>

<p>This code rewrites sequences rules to eliminate the counts -- that is, so that, in effect, <code>min = 1</code> and <code>max = 1</code>. The <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> fields are not actually changed but will no longer be meaningful.</p>
<p>It is assumed at this point that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>previous rewrites have eliminated <code>liberal</code> and <code>terminating</code> separation, so that only <code>proper</code> separation sequences and unseparated sequences remain.</p></li>
<li><p><code>min &gt; 0</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>the sequence rule's RHS has length of exactly 1.</p></li>
<li><p>the sequence is non-trivial, that either <code>min ~= 1</code> or <code>max ~= 1</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-the-repetend-instance"><a href="#TOC">Create the repetend instance</a></h2>
<p>Per the above assumptions, there is exactly one RHS symbol. The RHS symbol is called the <em>repetend</em>. It is the first (and only) symbol in <code>working_rule</code>.</p>

<p>I call a <em>block</em> a sequence of fixed length. I call a <em>block</em> a sequence of fixed length. I call any other sequence a <em>range</em>. If a range has no maximum length, I call it <em>open</em>. If a range is not open, then it is <em>closed</em>. If, in a sequence, <code>min == 1</code>, then I say the sequence is <em>1-based</em>.</p>
<h2 id="rewriting-out-sequences"><a href="#TOC">Rewriting out sequences</a></h2>
<p>The following code works first dividing the sequence into one or two 1-based sequences. If there is only one, the sequece may be a block or a range. If there are two, the block always comes first. If there is a range, it may be either open or closed.</p>
<p>We start by determining what sequences we have:</p>
<pre><code>
    -- luatangle: section Rewrite the sequence counts

    local block_size
    local range_size
    if min == max then
        block_size = max
    elseif min == 1 then
        range_size = max
    else
        block_size = min-1
        range_size = max == -1 and -1 or max-block_size
    end
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we've divided the range into at most two 1-based blocks. <code>block_size</code>, if non-nil, contains the size of a block. <code>range_size</code>, if non-nil, contains the size of a range. We create a new RHS, composed of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the block, if it is non-nil;</p></li>
<li><p>a separator, if it is needed; and</p></li>
<li><p>the range, if it is non-nil;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>and we change the <code>working_rule</code> accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="binarize-final-rule-hack"><a href="#TOC">Binarize: Final rule hack</a></h3>
<p>This hack covers a special case. It is required because, for every symbol, we need to determine its place in an external rule, in order to apply the semantics. The <code>xalt</code> and <code>rh_ix</code> fields in the winstances do this in most cases.</p>
<p>But what if a binarized rule contains two instances of the same nullable symbol. When we do the rewrite for nullables, we eliminate first one, then the other. But that results in two rules which are identical from the Libmarpa point of view. (Libmarpa does not see winstances.)</p>
<p>Various hacks will solve this -- for example we could allow ambiguous winstances, so that having only one rule is fine. That way the two cases -- nulling the first instance and nulling the second instance -- look different from the Libmarpa point of view.</p>
<p><code>final_wrule</code> was set previously We apply the hack only if <code>final_wrule</code> is nullable and has two symbols on its RHS.</p>
